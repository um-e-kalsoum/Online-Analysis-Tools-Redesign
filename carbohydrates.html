      It is important to recognize the great diversity of monosaccharides commonly encountered in animals, plants, and microbes, as well as to organize them in a visually interesting style that also emphasizes their similarities and relatedness. This article discusses the nature of building blocks, monosaccharides, and monosaccharide derivatives—terms commonly used in discussing “glycomolecules” found in nature. See Cummings <a href="https://glycotoolkit.com/Tools/periodic-table-of-monosaccharides/" target="_blank">"a Periodic Table of Monosaccharides"</a>

      <a href="https://glytoucan.org/" target="_blank">GlyTouCan</a> is the international glycan structure repository. This repository is a freely available, uncurated registry for glycan structures that assigns globally unique accession numbers to any glycan independent of the level of information provided by the experimental method used to identify the structure(s). Any glycan structure, ranging in resolution from monosaccharide composition to fully defined structures can be registered as long as there are no inconsistencies in the structure.

      While GlyTouCan provides stable identifiers for referencing glycan structures, they are not organized semantically. <a href="https://gnome.glyomics.org/" target="_blank">GNOme</a>, a glycan naming and subsumption ontology and a member of the OBOFoundry, organizes GlyTouCan accessions for automated reasoning and interactive browsing of glycan structures by subsumption. GNOme makes it quick and easy to discover glycans with a specific degree of characterization; provides a text-based table of common synonyms for specific structures and compositions; enumerates glycan subsumption relationships for automated reasoning; and assigns each glycan to well-defined categories based on their degree of characterization.

          <a href"https://www.glygen.org/">GlyGen</a> - is a data integration and dissemination project for carbohydrate and glycoconjugate related data. GlyGen retrieves information from multiple international data sources and integrates and harmonizes this data. This web portal allows exploring this data and performing unique searches that cannot be executed in any of the integrated databases alone. Glycan Sequence Lookup, Glycan Structure Dictionary, GlycoMotif Wiki, GlyGen BLAST, GlyGen Mapper,  GlyGen Isoform Mapper etc.

GLAD allows users to input multiple data files to create comparisons. GLAD extends the capability of the microarray data to produce more comparative visualizations in the form of grouped bar charts, heatmaps, calendar heatmaps, force graphs and correlation maps in order to analyze broad sets of samples.
